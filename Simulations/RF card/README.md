The file 74245.circ contains the partial model of a 74HC245 IC, made by me, used in the models contained in the other files. LogiSim-Evolution may prompt you to link the 74245 model when you open one of the other files.<br>
The file TalosES_RF_card.circ contains the minimum circuit for the RF card being used in-system, not as a standalone hand-held circuit. This file can be used as a model of the RF card in higher-level system-wide simulations.<br>
The file TalosES_RF_testbed.circ adds the modules required for displaying signals in LEDs and using the card in standalone mode, as a hand-held device.
