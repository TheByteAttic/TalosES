These LogiSim-evolution files simulate only small segments of Talos ESâ„¢'s motherboard circuitry, <i>not</i> the complete motherboard.
They are mostly for illustration purposes, as they have been used <a href="https://youtu.be/EE-lTyt0x98">in a video</a> and viewers may want to study them more closely.
