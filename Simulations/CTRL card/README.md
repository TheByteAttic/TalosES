These are the simulation files for Talos ESâ„¢'s control card, the heart of the system, which includes the RISC pipeline logic.
The file 74245.circ contains the partial model of a 74HC245 IC, made by me, used in the models contained in the other files. LogiSim-Evolution may prompt you to link the 74245 model when you open one of the other files.<br>
The file TalosES_CTRL_card.circ contains the minimum circuit for the CTRL card being used in-system, not as a standalone hand-held device. This file can be used as a model of the CTRL card in higher-level system-wide simulations. <b>HOWEVER,</b> the Decoding Memeories (DM3 to DM0) do NOT contain the appropriate contents; they assume the memories are only 256 bytes long and that no flags are used to address them. I hope to correct this later but, at this point, you would have to update the contents of those memories yourself, to make this work as a proper model.<br>
The file TalosES_AL_testbed.circ adds the modules required for displaying signals in LEDs and using the card in standalone mode, as a hand-held device. For now, the circuit is simplified so to make it easier to get initial simulation results: the flags have been removed and no conditional branches are implemented.
