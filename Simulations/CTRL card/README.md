These are the simulation files for Talos ESâ„¢'s control card, the heart of the system, which includes the RISC pipeline logic.
The file 74245.circ contains the partial model of a 74HC245 IC, made by me, used in the models contained in the other files. LogiSim-Evolution may prompt you to link the 74245 model when you open one of the other files.<br>
The file TalosES_CTRL_card.circ contains the minimum circuit for the CTRL card being used in-system, not as a standalone hand-held device. This file can be used as a model of the CTRL card in higher-level system-wide simulations. <b>HOWEVER,</b> the Decoding Memories (DM3 to DM0) do NOT contain the complete and appropriate contents; they assume the memories are only 256 bytes long and that no flags are used to address them. The complete and appropriate contents of the Decoding Memories will be in the CTRL card directory of this repository.<br>
The file TalosES_AL_testbed.circ adds the modules required for displaying signals in LEDs and using the card in standalone mode, as a hand-held device. For now, the circuit is simplified so to make it easier to get initial simulation results: the flags have been removed and no conditional branches are implemented.
