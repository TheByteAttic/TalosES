The file 74245.circ contains the partial model of a 74HC245 IC, made by me, used in the models contained in the other files. LogiSim-Evolution may prompt you to link the 74245 model when you open one of the other files.<br>
The file TalosES_ALU_card.circ contains the minimum circuit for the ALU card being used in-system, not as a standalone hand-held calculator. This file can be used as a model of the ALU card in higher-level system-wide simulations.<br>
The file TalosES_ALU_testbed.circ adds the modules required for displaying signals in LEDs and using the card in standalone mode, as a handheld binary calculator.<br>
