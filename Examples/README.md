Here you can find example applications that can be run on Talos ES™. You can copy the code in the text files above and paste it onto your PC's terminal window connected to Talos ES™ via an RS232 serial link (e.g., with a <i>standard</i> USB-to-serial, DB9 cable; <i>NOT</i> a null-modem one). For this purpose, I recommend TeraTerm with the terminal and serial connection settings illustrated below.<br><br>
The .BIN files should be placed in the root directory of a uSD card (class-10 or higher, FAT32 formatting) inserted in Talos ES™. The file DEMO.BIN, in particular, is automatically loaded by the firmware upon boot, so to display a blinken lights demo.<br>
