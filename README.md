# Talos ES™
Talos ES™ is a mini-computer built with standard, discrete logic (74-series chips) and featuring a custom RISC CPU. It's meant for education and entertainment. The project's official website can be found <a href="https://www.thebyteattic.com/p/talos-es.html">here</a>.<br>
This repository is currently incomplete and a work-in-progress. It will be slowly populated with material discussed in the episodes of a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=509XYuB6xsw&list=PLDf2uklC__d0CCgEDWJ5CoJgBmkGZ0vGv&ab_channel=TheByteAttic">video series chronicling the design</a>. After every episode of the on-going series, I will upload the files discussed to this repository.<br>
