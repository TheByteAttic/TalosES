# Talos ES™
Talos ES™ is a mini-computer built with standard, discrete logic (74-series chips) and featuring a custom RISC CPU. It's meant for education and entertainment. The project's official website can be found <a href="https://www.thebyteattic.com/p/talos-es.html">here</a>.<br><br>
This repository accompanies the technical material discussed in the episodes of a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=509XYuB6xsw&list=PLDf2uklC__d0CCgEDWJ5CoJgBmkGZ0vGv&ab_channel=TheByteAttic">video series chronicling the design</a>.<br><br>
The Talos ES™ project is now complete and all the relevant material is uploaded here. However, the documentation is still very limited or non-existent. Since this is a project that should be attempted only by fairly advanced hobbyists and students, and also because it is probably going to be made in only very small volumes (due to its high cost), I am currently not prioritizing the same level of documentation you can find in my other projects on Github, such as Agon™ and CERBERUS™. In fact, I don't intent to ever document it at that level, as I expect most users to be more interested in the lower-cost variation of Talos™, called Talos CR™, which I am currently working on. I intend to document this latter, lower-cost version more extensively. Talos ES™ is thus meant only for people who hardly need any documentation, having watched the video series.<br><br>
