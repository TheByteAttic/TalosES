# Talos ES™
Talos ES™ is a mini-computer built with standard, discrete logic (74-series chips) and featuring a custom RISC CPU. It's meant for education and entertainment. The project's official website can be found <a href="https://www.thebyteattic.com/p/talos-es.html">here</a>.<br><br>
This repository accompanies the technical material discussed in the episodes of a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=509XYuB6xsw&list=PLDf2uklC__d0CCgEDWJ5CoJgBmkGZ0vGv&ab_channel=TheByteAttic">video series chronicling the design</a>.<br><br>
The Talos ES™ project is now complete and all the relevant material is uploaded here. However, the documentation is very limited and sometimes non-existent. The reason is that I regard Talos ES™ mostly as a prototype for the upcoming, Cost-Reduced Talos CR™ version. I expect only very few people to attempt to build this prototype, due to its high cost and high complexity. Indeed, building a Talos ES™ should be attempted only by those who hardly need any documentation, given the video series.<br><br>
