<p>
Talos ES™ is a mini-computer built with standard, discrete logic (74-series chips) and featuring a custom RISC CPU. It's meant for education and entertainment. The project's official website can be found <a href="https://www.thebyteattic.com/p/talos-es.html">here</a>.<br><br>
This repository accompanies the technical material discussed in the episodes of a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=509XYuB6xsw&list=PLDf2uklC__d0CCgEDWJ5CoJgBmkGZ0vGv&ab_channel=TheByteAttic">video series chronicling the design</a>.<br><br>
The Talos ES™ project is now complete and all the relevant material is uploaded here. However, the documentation is very limited and sometimes non-existent. The reason is that I regard Talos ES™ mostly as a prototype for the upcoming, single-board, SMD-based, Cost-Reduced, Talos CR™ version. I expect only very few people to attempt to build this prototype, due to its high cost and high complexity. Indeed, building a Talos ES™ should be attempted only by hobbyists and students with plenty of experience not only with digital electronics in general, but ATmega microcontrollers and the Arduino IDE in particular. These are people who, having watched the video series, will hardly need any documentation anyway. If you are a beginner in electronics, please save yourself a lot of trouble and start with some other, simpler project.<br>
