Here you can find photos of a breadboard + Arduino Uno to burn the proper bootloader into Talos ES™'s ATmega1284P-PU I/O controller, prior to installing it into Talos ES™.. <i>Notice that, in the photos, a 16MHz oscillator is used; that was during the early prototyping phase. You should use an 18.432MHz oscillator instead and adjust the circuit accordingly, so that Talos ES™ optimally does serial transfers according to standard baud rates.</i>
