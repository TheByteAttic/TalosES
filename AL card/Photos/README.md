These are high resolution pictures of a correctly assembled TalesESâ„¢ AL card, which provide a reference if you are assembling your own. Please notice that the capacitor I am using in position C1 is a larger one than what is specified in the schematics and bill of materials. I am using a larger capacitor merely because I had a bunch of those lying around.

<b>ATTENTION:</b> The board illustrated in these photos differs slightly from the updated version (Gerber files) in this repository. This should be immaterial as far as using these photos as guidance during assembly is concerned, but you might note small differences.
