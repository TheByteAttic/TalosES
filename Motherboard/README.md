<b>UPDATE 4-March-2023</b>: There were errors in the design of the RESET circuit. I'm still debuging the board, so for the time being I've removed the board files to prevent anyone from having the PCB made with the errors in it. I'll upload the updated file as soon as I finish testing the whole thing.<br><p>
Design and manufacturing files for Talos ESâ„¢'s motherboard, which doubles as backplane board. <i>These files are NOT yet tested; I still have not received the prototype boards back, in order to verify functionality</i>. This is a four-layer board.<br>
