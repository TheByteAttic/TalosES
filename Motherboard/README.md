Design and manufacturing files for Talos ESâ„¢'s motherboard, which doubles as backplane board.
This is a four-layer board.<br>

<b>UPDATE NOTICE, 21 February 2024:</b> Two of the TVS diodes originaly used on this board were not optimally specified. The originals will work, but their operating voltage (5V) should have been 6V (RS232 operates between -6 and +6V). I've now replaced these diodes with the correct ones (SA6.0CA-E3/54, instead of the original SA5.0CA-E3/54) in the files above. This change does not affect the PCB itself, except for the silkscreen markings. If you already had this PCB made, <i>you do NOT need to have it made again.</i> I just recommend that you then replace diodes D4 and D5 with SA6.0CA-E3/54 parts, instead of the original SA5.0CA-E3/54 parts. Otherwise, the system will still work anyway, so this is just a precaution.

<b>DISCLAIMER:</b> As per the license of this repository, these files are provided as-is. To the best of my knowledge, the board works. However, the version I actually had made and tested was slightly different from the updated version in this repository now. The changes were minimal and I have no reason to believe that this updated version doesn't work; much to the contrary. Having said that, I have not had this updated version manufactured and tested, so I cannot offer any guarantees. Just as everything in all of my Github repositories, you use these files at your own risk.
