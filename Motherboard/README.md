<b>UPDATE 4-March-2023</b>: There were errors in the design of the RESET circuit. I'm still debuging the board, so for the time being I've removed the board files to prevent anyone from having the PCB made with the errors in it. I'll upload the updated files as soon as I finish testing the whole thing.<br><p>
