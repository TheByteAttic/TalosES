This directory contains high resolution pictures of a correctly-assembled Talos ESâ„¢'s ALU card. They are meant as a reference to help you assemble your own card.

<b>ATTENTION:</b> The board illustrated in these photos differs slightly from the updated version (Gerber files) in this repository. This should be immaterial as far as using these photos as guidance during assembly is concerned, but you might note small differences.
